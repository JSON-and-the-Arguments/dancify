# Dancify ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º
Our [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/projects/oct-2022/dancify) Final Project

## An app to allow you to connect with dancers nearby.
Dancify is an app that connects people who love to dance.
Anyone can sign up to the app, create a profile, setting your dance style, your role (as a lead or follow), and the range they wish to search for dance partners. Once you have your profile ready, you can message other dancers in order to meet up to practice your dance steps.

## Tech Stack
We used React Native, React Native Map, Tailwindcss, CSS, Axios, Expo, Firebase, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage for Firebase and Postcodes.io.

React Native was chosen as we already knew ReactJS and they have almost the same structure. Also, React native codebase can be shared among platforms. We used Tailwindcss to style our app because this is easy to work with. Cloud Firestore is Firebase's newest database for mobile app development.

## Challenges
- As team members, when we worked on the same component it would take a lot of time to deal with conflicts
- Learning the special features of new technologies was tricky at times, such as React Native and Expo
- When spiking different technologies, we encountered versions that did not go together well and solutions in the docs weren't clear
